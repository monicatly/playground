HW 2 afni_proc

Constructed timing files using make_timings.py and timing_tool.py to drop 1st TR

Experiment 1: 
	Dice Coefficient: .1978 - not good

Experiment 2:
	Without motion censoring and regression - Dice Coefficient: .2200
	With a smaller smoothing kernel - Dice Coefficient: .2745
	Using 3dREMLfit - Dice Coefficient: .1978

Edit (8/29/2017)
The above was done assuming sub-brick 17 was the correct statistic, but it probably wasn't. Instead, I used stats.sub_03+tlrc['L-D_GLT#0_Tstat']

Below is everything redone using the correct sub-brick.
Experiment 1:
	Dice Coefficient: .05296 - quite bad

Experiment 2:
	Without motion censoring and regression - Dice Coefficient: .02986 - much lower
		This makes sense, since leaving in bad motion volumes would decrease the similarity/reliability between the two samples
	With a smaller smoothing kernel - Dice Coefficient: .05976 - not much different
		I would expect a smaller smoothing kernel to result in a smaller Dice coefficient because the data would be noisier in each sample
	Using 3dREMLfit - Dice Coefficient: .00205 - much much lower
